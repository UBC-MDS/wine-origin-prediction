In our final version of this project, we addressed feedback received from both the MDS teaching team and our peers to improve our analysis, report, and documentation. Due to time constraints, we could not implement all suggestions, and instead prioritized the ideas we felt would be most impactful.

## Feedback on report
1. Hide the code blocks at the beginning of the report https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/63
2. Include captions for each figure, as well as the figure number for reference within the analysis https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/63
3. Added a more detailed Methods section https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/63
4. Create a plot to visualize class imbalance https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/64
5. provide the coefficient values and their corresponding interpretations from the model https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/65

## Documentation
1. Made analysis instructions more clear in README, listed dependencies required for running the project within the local environment using environment.yml https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/61
2. Added "Contributions" to the README https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/54 

## Analysis
1. Addressed issues with optimization.py and optimization_tests.py https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/61
2. Adressed issues with issues with accuracy_curve.py and test_accuracy_curve.py https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/65
3. Adressed issues with preprocessing function and tests https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/62

## Repreoducibility
1. Previously could not run script in docker; fixed here https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/66
2. Added raw data and corresponding script to repo based on Milestone 2 feedback https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/54
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/60
3. Set seed for splitting data to ensure consistent results https://github.com/UBC-MDS/wine-origin-prediction/pull/60
