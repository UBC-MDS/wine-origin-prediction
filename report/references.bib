	abstract = {Different classification methods (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, Extended Canonical Variates Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis), in combination with variable selection approaches (Forward Selection and Genetic Algorithms), were compared, evaluating their capabilities in the geographical discrimination of wine samples. Sixty-two samples were analysed by means of dynamic headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS) and the entire chromatographic profile was considered to build the dataset. Since variable selection techniques pose a risk of overfitting when a large number of variables is used, a method for coupling data dimension reduction and variable selection was proposed. This approach compresses windows of the original data by retaining only significant components of local Principal Component Analysis models. The subsequent variable selection is then performed on these locally derived score variables. The results confirmed that the classification models achieved on the reduced data were better than those obtained on the entire chromatographic profile, with the exception of Extended Canonical Variates Analysis, which gave acceptable models in both cases.

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {The certification of wine quality is essential to the wine industry. The main goal of this work is to develop a machine learning model to forecast wine quality using the dataset. We utilised samples from the red wine dataset (RWD) with eleven distinct physiochemical properties. With the initial RWD, five machine learning (ML) models were trained and put to the test. The most accurate algorithms are Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Using these two ML approaches, the top three features from a total of eleven features are chosen, and ML analysis is performed on the remaining features. Several graphs are employed to demonstrate the feature importance based on the XGBoost model and RF. Wine quality was predicted using relevant characteristics, often referred to as fundamental elements, that were shown to be essential during the feature selection procedure. When trained and tested without feature selection, with feature selection (RF), and with key attributes, the XGBoost classifier displayed 100\% accuracy. In the presence of essential variables, the RF classifier performed better. Finally, to assess the precision of their predictions, the authors trained an RF classifier, validated it, and changed its hyperparameters. To address collinearity and decrease the quantity of predictors without sacrificing model accuracy, we have also used cluster analysis.},

	abstract = {The major factors of wine trade have been showing distinct patterns of temporal trends worldwide in past decades. Wine consumption, production, imports, and exports differ according to their location and classification to Old World and New World wine markets. Using datasets from various sources, this work focused on quantifying long-term trends (1995–2021) of these wine industry factors for each country, including long-term means and temporal trends, using the Mann-Kendall trend test, and resulting in Z-scores. The temporal relationships between these global factors were quantified by applying Pearson correlation to the original values, as well as by correlating the Z-scores. Our findings show that Old World wine consumers and producers (e.g., Spain, France, and Italy) have been experiencing gradual decreasing trends of wine consumption and production. In New World countries, some of the largest wine-consuming countries were found to have strong, significant increases in wine consumption and new wine production markets show rapid growth trends. About 80\% of the countries demonstrated increasing trends of wine imports, signifying the impact of globalization on the wine market and the growing demand for foreign wine. Globally, consumption per capita was found to have significantly decreased. Wine production showed a strong, significant, and lagged dependence on wine consumption, which was also related to the temporal trends of wine imports and exports. The major forces driving the wine market are possibly economic growth and wider competition, with climate change acting as a disruptive force.},
