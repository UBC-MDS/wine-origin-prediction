    "With increased globalization, wine is consumed across a wider range of nations making wine trade an important part of the global economy (Orlandi, F. et al, 2015). For example, in 2021 wine exports increased by an average of 15% since 2017 reaching a global total of $40.7 billion (Jain, K. et al, 2023). Italy is one of the top 5 exporters of wine and together these countries contribute to 70.4% of the total wine exported globally (Jain, K. et al, 2023). As wine consumption becomes integrated into more cultures, there is an increased need for faster and efficient methods for wine certification, identication as well as quality evaluation. Our project focuses on one of those, namely, wine identification. \n",

    "Identification of the wine cultivar (e.g. 'Chardonnay' and 'Merlot') is an important element of consuming and selling wine (Ohana-Levi, N. et al, 2023). Traditional methods rely heavily on the knowledge and experience of indivdual experts which makes the process inherently subjective and labour-intensive. In this project, we aim to use a machine learning algorithm to identify the cultivar of Italian wines using 13 different physiochemical properties instead. This method takes advantage of the dense knowledge-base that exists about the important physiochemical properties of wine. It then utilizes quantitative measurements corresponding to these properties along with machine learning to systematically identify wine cultivars. Given that the wine industry has carved itself a name in global trade, it is crucial to develop and apply cutting-edge methods that can make these processes more accurate, less labour-intensive and cost-efficient. We think that this data-driven approach could be highly beneficial to the wine industry due to the benefits highlighted above.  "

    "We are using a multivariate dataset for this project that combines 13 physiochemical properties for 178 Italian wine samples. These samples correspond to 3 distinct cultivars from the same geographical location. The data was originally collected by M.Forina et al (Forina, M. et al, PARVUS - An Extendible Package for Data Exploration, Classification and Correlation. Institute of Pharmaceutical and Food Analysis and Technologies, Via Brigata Salerno, 16147 Genoa, Italy.) and contributed to the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository by Stefan Aeberhard and M. Forina in 1992 (last updated on Aug 28 2023). Details associated with the dataset can be found in the UC Irvine repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine) and the data can be read directly from here (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/109/data.csv). Each row of the dataset corresponds to one wine sample and contains measurements corresponding to each of the 13 physiochemical components. Identification and quantification of the different chemical constituents and properties of the wine was based on chromatographic profiles obtained through mass spectrometry(Ballabio, D. et al). This collection and experimentation was performed by Ballabio, D. et al. "
